SSO: how it works(how the flows happen)

Step-by-Step: SSO Login Flow (EASY version)
🥇 Step 1: You go to Canva
You open Canva.com (the Service Provider, or SP).
🥈 Step 2: You click “Login with Google”
Canva doesn’t check your password directly.
Instead, it redirects you to Google — your Identity Provider (IdP).
🥉 Step 3: Google login page appears
You see a Google login screen (accounts.google.com).
If you’re already logged in to Google, this step is skipped!
🏅 Step 4: You enter your credentials (if needed)

Google checks your email & password.
🪪 Step 5: Google creates a “token” (digital proof)
When login is successful, Google says:

“Yes, this person is verified!”

It then generates a secure token — kind of like a signed message.
📨 Step 6: Google sends the token back to Canva

Google sends this token back to Canva (the app you wanted to use).
🚪 Step 7: Canva verifies it
Canva checks the token.
If it’s really signed by Google (trusted source), Canva accepts it.
✅ Step 8: You’re logged in!
You can now use Canva — without creating a separate Canva password.

WHAT DOES SML DO....
its a protocol the whole SSO process done by SML... 
when we enter google from a app and give our credential(password,emal)if google(identity provider) said i am valid then SML creat a token and sent it to app(service provider)then app check this token and understand yes this user is valid...

HOW WE LOGIN IN MANY APP BY USING SAME EMAI(same credential)

How SSO Works “Again and Again”
When you log in via SSO, like Google or Microsoft:

First login: 
You enter your credentials at the Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., Google).
IdP verifies you and sends a token / SAML assertion to the Service Provider (SP) (e.g., Canva).
You’re logged in. ✅

Next time you open another app using the same SSO (e.g., YouTube, Drive, Zoom): 
The SP redirects you to the IdP again.
You don’t type your password, because Google already knows you’re logged in — it just reuses your existing session.
Google sends a new token to the new SP.
You’re logged in instantly. ✅

🧠 Key Idea

The SSO process (token exchange / SAML/OAuth) happens each time, but you don’t have to type your credentials every time.
The IdP remembers you via your session (usually via cookies).
Each app gets a fresh proof/token that says “Yes, this user is verified.”

When computers communicate over a network (like the internet or a LAN), they send data in small chunks called packets.
A packet sniffer listens to (or “sniffs”) those packets — like a CCTV camera for network traffic.

wireshark is a app that use for packet sniffing

⚙️ How It Works

The sniffer puts your network interface card (NIC) into promiscuous mode (so it can read all packets, not just ones addressed to your computer).

It captures packets as they travel on the network.

It displays details such as:

Source and destination IP addresses

Protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.)

Packet size

Contents (if not encrypted)

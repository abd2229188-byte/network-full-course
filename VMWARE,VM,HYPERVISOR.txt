{VMWARE: it‚Äôs a company that create hypervisor
HYPERVISOR: that helps to create or run many virtual  machine in one device
VM: each VM behaves like a separate computer ‚Äî it has its own CPU, memory, storage, and OS, but actually, all of that is shared from your real hardware.
 
so in summary VMware  actually a company who creates virtualisation software like hypervisor then hypervisor helps to create or run many virtual machines in one computer}

{HYPERVISOR: 2 TYPE
a)i ‚Üí Type 1 Hypervisor
	‚Ä¢	Installed directly on the hardware (no main OS).
	‚Ä¢	Used in servers and data centers.
	‚Ä¢	Very powerful and secure.
EX: VMware ESX

üíª b)  Type 2 Hypervisor
	‚Ä¢	Installed on top of Windows or Linux like normal software.
	‚Ä¢	Used by students, developers, and home users for testing or learning.EX:VMware Workstation / VMware Player,VIRTUAL BOX

VIRTUAL BOX:Type 2 Hypervisor
	‚Ä¢	Installed on top of Windows or Linux like normal software.
	‚Ä¢	Used by students, developers, and home users for testing or learning}

{PROXMOX:
Example:

If a physical server is a big hotel:
	‚Ä¢	VMs = Full apartments with their own furniture and kitchen (full OS)
	‚Ä¢	Containers = Small hotel rooms that share some facilities but are separate for guests (lighter, faster)
	‚Ä¢	Proxmox = The hotel manager + booking system that manages all apartments and rooms efficiently

‚∏ª

üß† Simple summary:

Proxmox = A free/enterprise platform that runs virtual machines and containers on a server, with an easy-to-use web interface.}

{HOSTOS AND GUESTOS:
Host OS (Host Operating System)
	‚Ä¢	This is the main operating system installed on your real physical computer.
	‚Ä¢	It controls the hardware (CPU, RAM, storage, network).
	‚Ä¢	The hypervisor runs on top of the Host OS (for Type 2 hypervisors).

Example:
	‚Ä¢	Your laptop has Windows 11 ‚Üí This is your Host OS.
	‚Ä¢	VirtualBox or VMware is installed on it.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Guest OS (Guest Operating System)
	‚Ä¢	This is the operating system inside the virtual machine (VM).
	‚Ä¢	It thinks it‚Äôs running on a real computer, but it actually uses the resources provided by the host through the hypervisor.

Example:
	‚Ä¢	Inside VirtualBox, you install Ubuntu Linux ‚Üí This is your Guest OS.
	‚Ä¢	You could also run Windows XP, Linux Mint, or anything else as another Guest OS.}

What is NTP?

NTP stands for Network Time Protocol.
It’s a system that keeps all computers’ clocks the same (synchronized) over a network — like the Internet or a local network.

💡 Imagine this:

You and your friends are doing a group exam online.
If everyone’s clock is different, one person might start early or finish late — unfair, right?
So you all check your watches with the same official clock.

That’s exactly what NTP does for computers!
It keeps all computers’ “watches” in sync with official time servers.

NTP measures how long messages take to travel (using 4 timestamps),
figures out the average delay,
then corrects your clock so it matches the server’s time accurately — usually within a few milliseconds!

Your computer uses these values to adjust its clock gradually —
not by jumping suddenly, but by slowing down or speeding up the internal timer a little,
so it gently matches the correct time.

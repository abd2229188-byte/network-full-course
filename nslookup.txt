nslookup helps you find which IP address belongs to a website, or which domain name belongs to an IP address — by asking the DNS (Domain Name System).




🧠 Why it’s used


Whenever you type something like www.google.com in your browser, your computer asks a DNS server:

“Hey, what’s the IP address of google.com?”

nslookup lets you ask that question directly and see the answer

Find the IP address of a domain:nslookup google.com
output will show:
Server:  dns.google
Address: 8.8.8.8

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    google.com
Address: 142.250.190.14
Find the domain name of an IP address (reverse lookup):
c:nslookup 142.250.190.14
Use a specific DNS server (like Google’s):
c:nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8

Get mail server (MX) records for a domain:
c:nslookup -type=MX gmail.com

Get name server (NS) records:
c:nslookup -type=NS google.com

What you can find using

How WLAN Covers a Whole University or Corporation

When they need Wi-Fi across a big area (like a campus, office building, or corporate headquarters), they donâ€™t use just one router â€”
they build a large WLAN system made of many connected access points (APs).

âš™ Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:
	1.	Multiple Access Points (APs):
	â€¢	Instead of one Wi-Fi router, they install dozens or hundreds of APs in different locations â€” classrooms, halls, offices, etc.
	â€¢	Each AP covers a small area (like 20â€“50 meters).
	â€¢	Together, all APs create one big wireless network.
	2.	Central Controller (WLC â€“ Wireless LAN Controller):
	â€¢	A WLC manages all access points from one place.
	â€¢	It decides which AP your device should connect to as you move (so Wi-Fi stays smooth without disconnecting).
	â€¢	Example: when you walk across the university, your phone automatically switches from one AP to another.
	3.	Wired Backbone:
	â€¢	All APs are connected by Ethernet cables to network switches and then to the main servers or internet router.
	â€¢	This wired backbone gives them high speed and reliability.
	4.	Security & Authentication:
	â€¢	They use systems like WPA2-Enterprise or RADIUS servers so only authorized students or employees can connect.
	5.	Network Management Software:
	â€¢	IT staff use software to monitor signal strength, speed, and device connections in real time.

ðŸ’¡ Example:

At MIT University, there might be:
	â€¢	400+ Access Points
	â€¢	10 Wireless Controllers
	â€¢	Thousands of users connected to the same campus WLAN

ðŸ§© In short:

Big organizations use many Access Points connected by cables, all controlled by one system, to create one large Wi-Fi network (WLAN).
